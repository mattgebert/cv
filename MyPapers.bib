	abstract = {Nanomechanical sensors and quantum nanosensors are two rapidly developing technologies that have diverse interdisciplinary applications in biological and chemical analysis and microscopy. For example, nanomechanical sensors based upon nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) have demonstrated chip-scale mass spectrometry capable of detecting single macromolecules, such as proteins. Quantum nanosensors based upon electron spins of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have demonstrated diverse modes of nanometrology, including single molecule magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we report the first step toward combining these two complementary technologies in the form of diamond nanomechanical structures containing NV centers. We establish the principles for nanomechanical sensing using such nanospin-mechanical sensors (NSMS) and assess their potential for mass spectrometry and force microscopy. We predict that NSMS are able to provide unprecedented AC force images of cellular biomechanics and to not only detect the mass of a single macromolecule but also image its distribution. When combined with the other nanometrology modes of the NV center, NSMS potentially offer unparalleled analytical power at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {Inducing long-range magnetic order in 3D topological insulators can gap the Dirac-like metallic surface states, leading to exotic new phases such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect or the axion insulator state. These magnetic topological phases can host robust, dissipationless charge and spin currents or unique magnetoelectric behavior, which can be exploited in low-energy electronics and spintronics applications. Although several different strategies have been successfully implemented to realize these states, to date these phenomena have been confined to temperatures below a few Kelvin. This review focuses on one strategy: inducing magnetic order in topological insulators by proximity of magnetic materials, which has the capability for room temperature operation, unlocking the potential of magnetic topological phases for applications. The unique advantages of this strategy, the important physical mechanisms facilitating magnetic proximity effect, and the recent progress to achieve, understand, and harness proximity-coupled magnetic order in topological insulators are discussed. Some emerging new phenomena and applications enabled by proximity coupling of magnetism and topological materials, such as skyrmions and the topological Hall effect, are also highlighted, and the authors conclude with an outlook on remaining challenges and opportunities in the field.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a large-area passivation layer for graphene by mechanical transfer of ultrathin amorphous Ga2O3 synthesized on liquid Ga metal. A comparison of temperature-dependent electrical measurements of millimeter-scale passivated and bare graphene on SiO2/Si indicates that the passivated graphene maintains its high field effect mobility desirable for applications. Surprisingly, the temperature-dependent resistivity is reduced in passivated graphene over a range of temperatures below 220 K, due to the interplay of screening of the surface optical phonon modes of the SiO2 by high-dielectric-constant Ga2O3 and the relatively high characteristic phonon frequencies of Ga2O3. Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements indicate that Ga2O3 passivation also protects graphene from further processing such as plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of Al2O3.},

	abstract = {Epitaxial graphene (EG) on cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) on silicon holds the promise of tunable nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices, some uniquely unlocked by the graphene/cubic silicon carbide combination, directly integrated with the current well-established silicon technologies. Yet, the development of graphene field-effect devices based on the 3C-SiC/Si substrate system has been historically hindered by poor graphene quality and coverage, as well as substantial leakage issues of the heteroepitaxial system. We address these issues by growing EG on 3C-SiC on highly resistive silicon substrates using an alloy-mediated approach. In this work, we demonstrate a field-effect transistor based on EG/3C-SiC/Si with gate leakage current 6 orders of magnitude lower than the drain current at room temperature, which is a vast improvement on the current literature, opening the possibility for dynamically tunable nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices on silicon at the wafer level.},
