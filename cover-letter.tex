    \pind I am writing to you to apply for the position of Senior Controls Engineer\cvreference{(\#PD-1851).}
    {https://careers.ansto.gov.au/job/Melbourne-Senior-Controls-Engineer-VIC/946930210/}I have recently conferred my doctoral program in experimental physics at the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence in 
    Future Low Energy Electronics \& Technologies (FLEET), based at Monash University under the supervision of Prof. Michael Fuhrer, 
    the director of FLEET. I additionally have completed undergraduate honours degrees in both electrical engineering and science, where I have specialised my 
    engineering education into digital and analogue electronic control systems. I am looking for an opportunity where I can
    use my skill-set in a scientific context, applying my skills in control systems and instrumentation. 

    % 1. Experience designing and implementing distributed control systems.
    % 3. Knowledge of data acquisition and real time control systems.
    \pind My doctoral program and engineering electives have given me a strong background in electronic control and measurement systems. I have designed and implemented 
    digital control loops for autonomous and time-critical tasks, such as a robotic puck competition, a PID-lock to a swinging pendulum, IQ-demodulation,
    digital clocks and real-time video-processors. I have implemented these systems on a variety of platforms, including microcontrollers, FPGAs and 
    programmable system-on-chip (SoCs). I also have analogue circuit design experience, where I have implemented a custom differential-amplifier, 
    and done some introductory work with RF circuit design.
    % Desirable 3. Experience with embedded controls, VME systems, motion controls, Instrumentation, PLCs, safety systems.
    A significant part of my doctoral experiments were to conduct low-noise electronic measurements of low-dimensional materials in strong magnetic fields. 
    To do this I have utilised a variety of electronic measurement equipment including lock-in amplifiers, sourcemeters and high-impedance preamplifiers, and their 
    respective automated acquisition through GPIB control using National Instruments LabView. These measurements were often performed in cryogenic UHV environments, 
    employing cryogenics and vacuum control principles. I have also been required to implement safe operating procedures (SOPs) and risk assessments for such equipment, 
    for the general use of other students and colleagues.

    % 2. The ability to program in at least one programming language with exposure to low level device programming.
    % Desirable 2. Advanced skills in C/C++. Software development experience on Linux and/or PLC platforms.
    \pind I am an avid programmer, with strong experience in Python, and significant experience in C/C++ and (V)HDL. I have full-stack experience, often using linux
    operating systems (including for fabrication tools such as the Raith EBPG5000plusES), and am hosting and running a personal website using the Django framework. 
    I am competent in low-level programming and logic as previously mentioned, and have recently started using 3D printers and CNC machines which incorporate motion.
    I have participated in summer work experience at the Synchrotron in 2012, working on web-UI elements of the MyTardis project particularly for Xray diffraction datasets.

    % 4. The ability to perform and document design reviews relative to data acquisition and real time control.
    \pind I have significant experience in documenting reproducible work to a scientific standard. This includes code bases, with utilisation of standards and tools such as
    version control, program typing, unit testing and documentation styles such as NumpyDoc. While I have not been required to document design reviews in a control context 
    explicitly, I have worked with significant amounts of CAD design and documentation, such as design documents for custom UHV parts and SOP documentation.
    % 5. The ability to develop relevant working standards and instructions relative to control systems.
    As mentioned, I have an understanding of software-development standards and have developed a number of SOP, and this will enable me to develop relevant
    working standards and instructions in control system contexts. One of my PhD forte's was optimising procedures, particularly for high quality samples, and I believe 
    producing a pragmatic, clear set of instructions and standards can benefit many users, operators and handover.

    % 6. The ability to quickly understand scientific concepts to a sufficient level to provide the support needed.
    % 7. The ability to communicate and collaborate with various technical groups, engineers, scientists other experts in their field to gain accurate and relevant information.
    % Desirable 1. Experience in a science environment or light source facility
    % 8. The ability to work autonomously or with limited supervision.
    \pind During my doctoral program, I have developed a strong background in experimental physics, with a focus on the development of novel instrumentation and 
    fabrication/measurement techniques for the study of low dimensional materials. Part of this program involved performing measurements at the ANSTO's Lucas Heights
    facility, where I used the Platypus beamline to perform neutron reflectometry measurements. I am professionally aware of safety procedures and protocols 
    in such institutions where security and safety are paramount. The breadth of knowledge required for my doctoral candidature demonstrates that I am also quick to learn 
    conceptual ideas, new skills and techniques, particularly as my thesis involved nanofabrication, molecular-beam epitaxy, electronic-transport and spectroscopic measurements.
    Whilst I find managerial supervision very useful, I have been working autonomously for quite some time particularly in experimental contexts.
    I am a clear communicator, not only demonstrated by multiple conference presentations during my candidature, but also through extensive co-curricular teaching, 
    leadership, volunteering and governance experience. My multidisciplinary background allows me to easily communicate and collaborate with numerous technical groups relevant
    to the Synchrotron facility, particularly amongst the Controls \& Scientific Computing team, and I professionally know a number of scientists and engineers 
    who work at the facility.

    \pind I believe my breadth of professional experience makes me an ideal candidate for the position of Senior Controls Engineer, and I am very excited by the opportunity to
    contribute to the significant work that is undertaken at the Synchrotron. If you have any questions or seek further clarification, please don't hesitate to contact me.
    I look forward to hearing from you soon.
