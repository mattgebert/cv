    \pind I am writing to you to apply for the position of Research Fellow - Metasuraces.\cvreference{(\#JR26945).}
    {https://rmit.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/RMIT_Careers/job/Melbourne/Research-Fellow---Metasurfaces_JR26945}
    I have recently conferred my doctoral program in experimental condensed-matter physics at the Australian Research Council's 
    Centre of Excellence in Future Low Energy Electronics \& Technologies (FLEET), based at Monash University
    under the supervision of Prof. Michael Fuhrer, the director of FLEET. 
    I additionally have completed undergraduate honours degrees in both electrical engineering and science, where I have specialised my 
    engineering education into digital and analogue electronic control systems. I am looking for an opportunity where I can
    use the combination of my nanofabrication, physics and engineering backgrounds.

    % 1. Demonstrated excellent research track record in the field of electromagnetics, and microwave circuit and systems.
    % 2. Demonstrated ability to experimentally realise and characterise microwave devices and systems.
    \pind While I do not have a substantial research background in electromagnetics and microwave circuits and systems, I have studied 
    electrical engineering masters units such as \cvreference{ECE5882 Advanced Electronic Design}{https://handbook.monash.edu/2024/units/ECE5882}
    where I have gained familiarity with transmission-line impedance-matched networks, and analogue constituents.
    As part of this particular unit, I designed and built an analogue IQ Radio Module, both simulating (LTSpice) and 
    implementing relevant components onto a PCB, such as Colpitts oscillator, bandpass filters and mixers.

    \pind Relevant to the processing of metasurfaces for RF components, my doctoral research involved the fabrication and characterisation
    of nanoscale electronic devices, which required significant surface processing techniques, 
    including understanding of material contacts, and the effects present at interfaces of 2D materials. 
    I particular, investigated Dirac fermions surfaces, and their influenced by magnetic and dielectric materials.
    % 3. Proven ability to undertake scientific research and development in research programs.
    

    % 5. Demonstrated initiative in research and problem solving.

    % 6. Demonstrated ability to work effectively both as a member of a research team and independently when
    % required, to meet project outcomes and milestones.

    
    % 4. Demonstrated ability to clearly communicate research results, concepts and knowledge.
    % 7. Ability to co-supervise postgraduate by research students.
    % 8. Ability to contribute to the teaching and learning program in a relevant field.
    I have published (and designed successful cover-art) in this field\cvreference{(Nano Lett. 2023, 23, 1, 363â€“370),}{https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03492}
    and have presented my work at multiple international conferences including ICPS (International conference for the physics of
    semiconductors) 2022 and the APS (American Physics Society) March Meeting 2023. I am a skilled communicator and educator,
    with significant experience in tutoring university students, and teaching high-school specialist classes. I have additionally served
    in numerous govenance/adcovate roles within academic contexts, such as the Monash Academic Board, 
    and the Monash Faculty of Science Postgraduate Committee. I have also successfully supervised two student projects, 
    an undergraduate and a masters student.
