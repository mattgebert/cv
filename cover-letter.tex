    \pind I am writing to you to apply for the position of Research Fellow - Metasuraces\cvreference{(\#JR26945).}
    {https://rmit.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/RMIT_Careers/job/Melbourne/Research-Fellow---Metasurfaces_JR26945}
    I have recently conferred my doctoral program in experimental condensed-matter physics at the Australian Research Council's 
    Centre of Excellence in Future Low Energy Electronics \& Technologies (FLEET), based at Monash University
    under the supervision of Prof. Michael Fuhrer, the director of FLEET. 
    I additionally have completed undergraduate honours degrees in both electrical engineering and science, where I have specialised my 
    engineering education into digital and analogue electronic control systems. I am looking for an opportunity where I can
    use the combination of my nanofabrication, physics and engineering backgrounds.

    % 1. Demonstrated excellent research track record in the field of electromagnetics, and microwave circuit and systems.
    % 2. Demonstrated ability to experimentally realise and characterise microwave devices and systems.
    \pind While I do not have a substantial research background in electromagnetics and microwave circuits and systems, I have studied 
    electrical engineering masters units such as \cvreference{ECE5882 Advanced Electronic Design}{https://handbook.monash.edu/2024/units/ECE5882}
    where I have gained familiarity with transmission-line impedance-matched networks, and analogue constituents.
    As part of this particular unit, I designed and built an analogue IQ Radio Module, both simulating (LTSpice) and 
    implementing relevant components onto a PCB, such as Colpitts oscillator, bandpass filters and mixers.

    \pind Relevant to the processing of metasurfaces for RF components, my doctoral research involved significant synthesis, fabrication
    and characterisation techniques for nanoscale electronic devices. Surface sensitive processing techniques including electron-beam 
    \& photo-lithography, deposition methods (ALD, CVD, E-beam, PVD) and etching (wet, dry, plasma, reactive) methods.
    To perform transport measurements required an understanding of material contacts, cryogenic and UHV systems, and allowed me to 
    investigate the effects present at interfaces of 2D materials. I have familiarity with probestations, wirebonding, chip carriers, 
    low-frequency PCB design, and other equipment relevant to RF and microwave systems.
    
    % 3. Proven ability to undertake scientific research and development in research programs.
    % 5. Demonstrated initiative in research and problem solving.
    % 6. Demonstrated ability to work effectively both as a member of a research team and independently when
    % required, to meet project outcomes and milestones.
    \pind During my candidature I investigated Dirac fermion surface states (Graphene, topological insulators), and their influenced by
    magnetic and dielectric materials. My research into Dirac fermions has been conducted both with strong independence, but also 
    featuring collaborative aspects such utilising liquid metals research from Prof. Torben Daenke's group at RMIT to synthesise 
    gallium oxide. Such devices required innovative methods to transfer clean sheets of gallium oxide, without gallium liquid metal 
    residues. I was able to develop and refine a method to transfer clean, nanometer-thick, mm-scale sheets onto graphene FET devices.
    This work has been published (with successful designed cover-art) in this 
    field\cvreference{(Nano Lett. 2023, 23, 1, 363â€“370),}{
    https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03492}
    Further, I have participated in the wider objectives of FLEET's research programs and collaborations, participating in many 
    workshops and seminars.
    
    % 4. Demonstrated ability to clearly communicate research results, concepts and knowledge.
    % 7. Ability to co-supervise postgraduate by research students.
    % 8. Ability to contribute to the teaching and learning program in a relevant field.
    \pind I have presented my work at multiple international conferences including ICPS (International conference for the physics of
    semiconductors) 2022 and the APS (American Physics Society) March Meeting 2023. I am a skilled communicator and educator,
    with significant experience in tutoring university students, and teaching high-school specialist classes. I have also learned Blender
    and consequently designed two (accepted) journal covers for my publications. I have also successfully supervised two student projects, 
    an undergraduate and a masters student. Additionally, I have served in numerous govenance/adcovate roles within academic contexts, 
    including the Monash Academic Board, and the Monash Faculty of Science Postgraduate Committee. 

    \pind One more relevant skill I have is programming competency, which I have used extensively throughout my education. I am very familiar
    with numerical libraries in Python, and am able to establish code from microcontroller/embedded systems through to web-developement.
    I am also well aware of modern programming best-practise, such as version control, testing, and documentation.

    \pind Relevant to the role, I am an Australian citizen, I have a working with children check (WWCC), and would be happy to perform a
    police check.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    \pind In summary, I have extensive cleanroom fabrication experience, with an excellent introduction to the physics of RF and microwave
    technology stemming from my electrical engineering studies. My doctoral award in experimental condensed-matter physics demonstrates
    my ability to analyse and investigate surface effects in materials, particularly relevant for metasurfaces.
    I have a strong record of teaching and outreach experience, including the mentorship and supervision of undergraduate and graduate students.
    For these outlined reasons, I believe I could be an excellent candidate for this research fellow position.
